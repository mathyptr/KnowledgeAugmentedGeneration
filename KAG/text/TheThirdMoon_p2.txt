It was a beautiful day in Noort, just one of those days that immediately puts you in a good mood.
The sun was shining high in the sky, its rays falling gently to the ground; there was just a breath of wind.
Noort was a small village in northern Galea, inhabited by no more than 500 people. One of those typical villages where everyone knows everyone and rumors are constantly spreading. In short, if something new happened, everyone would know within half an hour.
Old Mrs. Blingof would immediately run to Miss Listrop, ready to tell the latest rumor, and Miss Listrop, in turn, would immediately run to Sonia Marcy, who would let everyone know. Sonia was truly a beautiful woman; everyone envied her, and well, who could blame them?
Despite her age, she still had a perfect body, and there wasn't even a hint of a wrinkle on her face. She was a very cheerful woman, she worked at the town bakery and loved her job; everyone knew it. But she, just like everyone else, had a flaw: if you told her something, you could be sure everyone would know.
The bells began to ring: it was already eight o'clock.
