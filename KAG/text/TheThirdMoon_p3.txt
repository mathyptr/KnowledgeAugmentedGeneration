Sixteen-year-old Violette Hollan had just woken up to the sun's rays shining on her face.
She tried to get out of bed but couldn't. Something was holding her back.
After breakfast, she decided to go to the usual village park, where she met every day with her dear friends Alex Green and Rose Martew.
As she walked to the park, her red hair fluttered in the wind and her blue eyes shone in the sunlight.
She couldn't wait to meet up with her friends, the only ones who understood her.
She loved her parents very much, but they didn't understand her passion for literature.
They wanted their daughter to find a good job, and her father, Andrew Hollan, a doctor, had decided that Violette would pursue medicine.
Her mother, Jeanne Crost, a lawyer, fully agreed with her husband about the future of her beloved daughter.
But Violette couldn't help but write every story she could think of, even the most unlikely ones.
Some time ago, she had begun writing a strange story about a certain town called Lonmay.
She had recounted the lives of all the characters and carefully described every part of the town.
She kept thinking of some plot twist, something astonishing and incredible, but only banal and overly obvious ideas came to her.
She thought it was "writer's block" or something like that.
She had no idea what was about to happen to her.
