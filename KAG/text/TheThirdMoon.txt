Lonmay was one of the many cities of Galea, a world billions and billions of light years away from Earth.
The usual domed houses, the usual gardens, and the usual narrow streets;
But there was one thing that characterized Lonmay and set it apart from other cities like the enormous Scolin.
Something few had seen.
Something that could only be seen when the two moons, Ernio and Sirio, overlapped with the third moon: Taul.
Something quite strange and peculiar. Difficult to overcome, but not impossible.
There were many legends that spoke of it. Legends and myths, few knew the truth.
Storn was its name. In the Lonmay dialect, "storn" meant "difficult."
It was a beautiful day in Noort, just one of those days that immediately puts you in a good mood.
The sun was shining high in the sky, its rays falling gently to the ground; there was just a breath of wind.
Noort was a small village in northern Galea, inhabited by no more than 500 people. One of those typical villages where everyone knows everyone and rumors are constantly spreading. In short, if something new happened, everyone would know within half an hour.
Old Mrs. Blingof would immediately run to Miss Listrop, ready to tell the latest rumor, and Miss Listrop, in turn, would immediately run to Sonia Marcy, who would let everyone know. Sonia was truly a beautiful woman; everyone envied her, and well, who could blame them?
Despite her age, she still had a perfect body, and there wasn't even a hint of a wrinkle on her face. She was a very cheerful woman, she worked at the town bakery and loved her job; everyone knew it. But she, just like everyone else, had a flaw: if you told her something, you could be sure everyone would know.
The bells began to ring: it was already eight o'clock.
Sixteen-year-old Violette Hollan had just woken up to the sun's rays shining on her face.
She tried to get out of bed but couldn't. Something was holding her back.
After breakfast, she decided to go to the usual village park, where she met every day with her dear friends Alex Green and Rose Martew.
As she walked to the park, her red hair fluttered in the wind and her blue eyes shone in the sunlight.
She couldn't wait to meet up with her friends, the only ones who understood her.
She loved her parents very much, but they didn't understand her passion for literature.
They wanted their daughter to find a good job, and her father, Andrew Hollan, a doctor, had decided that Violette would pursue medicine.
Her mother, Jeanne Crost, a lawyer, fully agreed with her husband about the future of her beloved daughter.
But Violette couldn't help but write every story she could think of, even the most unlikely ones.
Some time ago, she had begun writing a strange story about a certain town called Lonmay.
She had recounted the lives of all the characters and carefully described every part of the town.
She kept thinking of some plot twist, something astonishing and incredible, but only banal and overly obvious ideas came to her.
She thought it was "writer's block" or something like that.
She had no idea what was about to happen to her.
