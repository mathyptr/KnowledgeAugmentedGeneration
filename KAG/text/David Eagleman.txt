David Eagleman is an American neuroscientist, author, and science communicator. 
He was born in 1971 in New Mexico and developed an early interest in how the brain constructs reality. 

Eagleman is widely known for his research on time perception, synesthesia, and brain plasticity. 
He has conducted experiments showing how the brain can stretch or compress the subjective experience of time under different conditions. 
His work on synesthesia explores how sensory regions of the brain can produce cross-modal perceptions.

He served as a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, where he founded the Laboratory for Perception and Action. 
Later, he joined Stanford University as an adjunct professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.

Eagleman is also the founder of the Center for Science and Law, an organization that studies how neuroscience can inform legal systems. 
Through this center, he has collaborated with judges, lawyers, and policymakers to integrate scientific understanding into legal decision-making.

As an author, Eagleman has written both scientific and popular books. 
His best-known work is "Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives", a collection of philosophical short stories that explore imaginative scenarios about consciousness and identity. 
He also co-authored “The Runaway Species”, a book on human creativity written with composer Anthony Brandt.

In addition to his academic work, Eagleman has participated in public science communication.
He hosted the television series "The Brain with David Eagleman", produced by PBS, which introduced viewers to the mechanisms of human cognition. 
He has also given numerous public lectures and TED Talks on topics related to neuroscience, perception, and creativity.

Eagleman collaborates with technology companies working on sensory substitution, wearable devices, and neuro-enhancement tools. 
He is the co-founder of Neosensory, a company that develops haptic-based devices to help deaf individuals experience sound through touch.

Today, Eagleman continues to write, teach, and conduct research while advocating for a deeper public understanding of how the brain shapes human experience.
