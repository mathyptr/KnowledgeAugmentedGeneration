SolarTech Innovations, a renewable energy startup headquartered in Berlin, unveiled its latest product 'EcoGrid Battery' during the annual Clean Energy Summit in June 2023. The advanced energy storage system was co-developed with OceanWave Labs, utilizing their marine-based cooling technology. CEO Dr. Helena Weiss confirmed the product will be distributed through GreenHub Stores across Europe starting Q1 2024. Technical specifications reveal the battery integrates patented 'NanoCool' modules, a breakthrough first presented at last year's Berlin Tech Expo. Environmental analysts predict this collaboration could reduce urban carbon emissions by 40% within five years.
