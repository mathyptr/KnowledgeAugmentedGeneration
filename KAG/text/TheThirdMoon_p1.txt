Lonmay was one of the many cities of Galea, a world billions and billions of light years away from Earth.
The usual domed houses, the usual gardens, and the usual narrow streets;
But there was one thing that characterized Lonmay and set it apart from other cities like the enormous Scolin.
Something few had seen.
Something that could only be seen when the two moons, Ernio and Sirio, overlapped with the third moon: Taul.
Something quite strange and peculiar. Difficult to overcome, but not impossible.
There were many legends that spoke of it. Legends and myths, few knew the truth.
Storn was its name. In the Lonmay dialect, "storn" meant "difficult."
