Donald Duck, or simply Donald Duck, is a cartoon and comic book character known and loved throughout the world.
The quintessential antihero, unlucky and irascible, he began as a minor character but quickly rose to prominence, establishing himself as a sort of "anti-Mickey Mouse" in the Disney universe.
Donald Duck was born on June 9, 1934, with his first appearance in The Wise Little Hen, an animated short from the "Happy Symphonies" series, in which he plays the vice president of the Lazy People's Club.
A great slacker, he is accompanied by his president, Meo Porcello, a character who would only appear in one other Disney cartoon. Already on this occasion, Donald Duck is wearing his trademark blouse and sailor cap. But instead of hands, he still has duck wings and a particularly elongated beak.
Born as a one-off character and nothing more, Donald Duck was promoted to Mickey Mouse's gang: the two "acted" together that same year, in the short "A Charity Night." On this occasion, the angry duck with the quacking voice stole the show from his more famous "colleague," creating repeated gags, a phenomenon that continued in subsequent cartoons. Meanwhile, Donald's beak shortened and his wings became hands. In 1937, the character received his own series, which would prove to be the most prolific of the next twenty years.
Donald Duck began as a slacker, but from his second appearance, other character traits emerged: his short temper and great bad luck. However, Donald Duck didn't have all his negative traits; far from it: he was also generous and loyal, even brave when the situation called for it.
Duckburg, along with Mousetown, is one of the two fictional cities in which Disney comics are set. This is where all (or almost all) of the most famous characters from the Donald Duck universe live.
Scrooge McDuck, Donald Duck's extremely rich and miserly uncle, is one of the most beloved Disney characters, despite his character being modeled after Ebenezer Scrooge (he is actually called Scrooge McDuck in English-speaking countries), the greedy protagonist of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol."
Gladstone is a duck who is always elegantly dressed and has blond curls. Gladstone is shamelessly lucky and a rival for his cousin Donald Duck: the two "compete" for Daisy Duck.
Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the children of Donald Duck's sister, Dealla. Huey, Dewey, and Louie debuted alongside their uncle in a 1937 comic book and were already starring in a short film the following year.
Like Gladstone, Goofy is also Donald Duck's cousin. But he's not lucky; on the contrary, he's as clumsy as Donald Duck, if not more so, very naive, and always ready to involve him in unlikely adventures.
Gyropship is the brilliant inventor who debuted in the United States in 1952: he owes his Italian name to the cartoonist Guido Martina, who wanted to pay homage to both Pythagoras and Archimedes.
Daisy Duck is the great (not always) reciprocated love of the most famous duck of all time, appearing for the first time in a 1940 cartoon.
Amelia is a witch. Amelia has long dark hair and always dresses in black. Amelia doesn't live in Duckburg but in a small house on the slopes of Vesuvius.
Donald Duck's paternal grandmother and great-grandmother of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, she is a country duck but above all an exceptional cook. Ciccio, her nephew/helper, knows this well, as he spends most of his time eating or sleeping.
The Beagle Boys are a gang of thieves. Their numbers vary from story to story: the only certainty is that they are anthropomorphic dogs and that they are desperate to rob the incredibly wealthy Scrooge McDuck.
